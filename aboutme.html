                    <h1>MY STORY</h1>
                    <p>I am a Software Engineer who wants to create simple and intuitive user interfaces that elevate the online presence. <br>
                    I was born and raised in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. I moved to the United States at 12, becoming a first-generation immigrant. Although I faced many struggles, including language and cultural barriers, I worked hard to create opportunities for myself which led to earning a Full-Ride Scholarship and graduating with a degree in Business Administration.
                    I have always been interested in working with technology, which steered me into becoming a Software Engineer. I completed a certification through General Assembly. I love incorporating aesthetic designs and functional working code to make beautiful website. Feel free to contact me if you want to say hello or have any questions!</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Things I Love</h1>
                    <p>Dogs, coding, hiking, eating, rock climbing, drawing, and binge watching TV series! </p>
